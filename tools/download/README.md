# Python-based Data Downloader

Shell script-based data downloader is prepared in [open-pack/openpack-dataset](https://github.com/open-pack/openpack-dataset/blob/main/docs/DOWNLOAD.md).
However, it does not support downloading data from Google Drive and it is not easy to configure.
This download tool provides another option to set up datasets in your environment.
