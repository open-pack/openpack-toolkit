# Preprocessed Dataset

Sensors used in the OpenPack dataset have different sampling rates.
Therefore, each sensor is stored in a separate file. When you use them, you have to combine them using timestamps assosiated with each record.
But we understand that it's not easy for the new users.

Here, we will provide codes which is used to make preprocessed datasets.
Please refer this sample when you implement your own preprocessing.
