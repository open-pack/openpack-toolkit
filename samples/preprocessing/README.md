# Preprocessed Dataset

Sensors used in the OpenPack dataset have different sampling rates.
Therefore, each sensor is stored in a separate file. When you use them, you have to combine them using timestamps associated with each record.
But we understand that it's not easy for the new users.

Here, we will provide codes which are used to make preprocessed datasets.
Please refer to this sample when you implement your preprocessing code.
