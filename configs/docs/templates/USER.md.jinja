# Subjects and Data Collection Scenario

We invited 16 distinct subjects for our data collection.
The ages of the subjects are between 20s and 50s.
Here is information for currently available users.

## Meta Data

| Subject | Sex | Age | Dominant Hand | Experience | Note |
|---------|-----|-----|---------------|------------|------|
{% for user in users %}
| {{ user.name }} | {{user.meta.sex}} | {{user.meta.age_group}} | {{user.meta.dominant_hand}} | {{user.meta.packaging_experience}} | {{user.meta.note}} |
{% endfor%}


## Sessions

In the competition, predicted sequence will be evaluated within the following interval (`[Start, End]`).

| Subject | Session | Scenario | Duration | Start | End |
|---------|---------|----------|----------|-------|-----|
{% for user in users %}
{% for session_id, session in user.sessions.items() %}
| {{ user.name }} | {{session_id}} | {{user.meta.scenarios[session_id]}} | {{session.duration}} | {{session.start|replace("T", " ")}} | {{session.end|replace("T", " ")}} |
{% endfor%}
{% endfor%}

## Scenarios

### Scenario.1 (S1)

we asked the subjects to follow the work instructions as much as possible. While a list of items in an order is determined based on order sheets collected in actual logistics centers, the probabilities with which very large/small items are included in an order are moderate (higher than actual probabilities). 

### Scenario.2 (S2)

TBA

### Scenario.3 (S3)

TBA

### Scenario.4 (S4)
