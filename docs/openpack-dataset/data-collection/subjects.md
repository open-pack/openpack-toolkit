Subjects with IDs starting with `U01` have data for only Scenario 1, while subjects with IDs starting with `U02` have data for Scenarios 2-4.
Data for Secenario 2-4 was collected more than 2 month after the data collection for Scenario 1.
Five subjects participated in both data collections, but were assigned different IDs because there was a long time interval to forgot or improve their skills.
Therefore, there are 21 subjects but the number of distinct subject is 16.
See table above for the information on the overlapping subjects.
