## Activity Class Definitions

Data was annotated by three expert annotators by reference to the RGB images.
Definition of activity class was made with the help of industrial engineers.
In the latest version, three types of annotations are available: (1) work operations, (2) action, and (3) outliers.

### [1] Work Operations (`OPENPACK_OPERATIONS`)

Operation clases are defined based on an instruction document used in an actual logistics center.
The document specifies a sequence of work operation performbed by workers.
In the data collection, the subjects basically followed the instructions for packing.
Ten operations written in the document are annotated. Here are definitions of the ten operations.

In the `opnepack-toolkit`, this operation class set is implemented as `openpack_toolkit.OPENPACK_OPERATIONS`.
Also, a list of work operations are available in the YAML format. See [openpack-toolkit:configs/dataset/annotation/openpack-operations.yaml](https://github.com/open-pack/openpack-toolkit/blob/main/configs/dataset/annotation/openpack-operations.yaml)

### [2] Actions (`OPENPACK_ACTIONS`)

In an instruction document, each operation are explained in details.
For example, a description of the “relocate item label” operation is given as “Remove the label from the items and place it on the bottom margin of the packaging list. Check the product name and quantity on the list and label with a ballpoint pen.”
As you can see, each operation consists of mutiple actions. Many actions are similar to each other but some of them are unique to a specific operatoin.
In general, to recognize complex activities such as work operation, understanding the relation among small actions are important.
Therefore, to enable research to recognize hierarchical activity classes, we annotated the actions as follows.

In the `opnepack-toolkit`, this action class set is implemented as `openpack_toolkit.configs.dataset.annotation.OPENPACK_ACTIONS`.
Also, a list of action labels are available in the YAML format. See [openpack-toolkit:configs/dataset/annotation/openpack-actions.yaml](https://github.com/open-pack/openpack-toolkit/blob/main/configs/dataset/annotation/openpack-operations.yaml)

### [3] Outlier Events (`OPENPACK_OUTLIERS`)

In principle, a worker repetitively performs a sequence of predefined operations, but mistakes and other unexpected actions occur.
Because these outliers can decrease product quality and productivity, managers of industrial sites want to detect such harmful activities.
Therefore, OpenPack annotated 45 outlying events over seven categories that are not specified in the work instructions.

We categorize outlying activities as follows:

- **(A-a) Incident**: This category is assigned to a time segment when a worker makes a mistake or suffers from an accident, e.g., dropping dry cells on the ground.
- **(A-b) Investigation**: This category is assigned to a segment when a worker investigates the current situation to avoid additional mistakes or accidents after the incident occurs, e.g., a segment when a subject re-confirms the work procedures.
- **(A-c) Recovery**: Activities to correct errors after a mistake or an accident, e.g., when a worker changes the shipping box size and assembles it again.
- **(B) Struggling**: Workers sometimes struggle to complete an operation, e.g., the barcode on an item is difficult to scan.
- **(C) Confused**: When workers lose the next procedure, they sometimes stop working. Segments corresponding to a work stoppage are classified in this category.
- **(D) Parallel**: Skilled workers can perform two tasks in parallel. This category is assigned to segments with overlapping operation/action labels.
- **(E) Additional**: Activities that are not included in the work-instruction documents but are necessary to complete shipping orders, such as preparing a new adhesive tape when the old one gets used up.

Note that the outlier categories are defined to classify events that may affect the work activity recognition performance, including mistakes. Some categories are similar to each other; therefore, the differences among the outlier categories are noted below.

- (A-a) Incident, (A-b) investigation, and (A-c) recovery are categories related to mistakes or errors. These categories were assigned to each phase of mistakes, from the action that caused the mistake, confirmation of the situation, to recovery.
- Both (B) struggling and (C) confused are categories for a state, in which the work progress is stalled; however, "struggling" is a category for a state, in which the subject continues to move, while "confused" is a /category for a state, in which the movement has stopped.
- (A-c) Recovery and (E) additional are classified based on whether they are related to work errors or not.
- Actions included in (E) additional are those that are not part of the job description but are important for efficient work, such as cleaning the workbench. There is a difference in the way these actions are executed between skilled workers and others. However, because they are large movements, and thus affect the sensor data, we annotated these actions.

The following table shows the list of annotated outlier events.
The above outlying labels contain auxiliary information regarding types of related events as "Tags", in the incident category facilitating analysis of outlying activities.

In the `opnepack-toolkit`, this outlier event set is implemented as `openpack_toolkit.configs.dataset.annotation.OPENPACK_OUTLIERS`.
Also, a list of action labels are available in the YAML format. See [openpack-toolkit:configs/dataset/annotation/openpack-actions.yaml](https://github.com/open-pack/openpack-toolkit/blob/main/configs/dataset/annotation/openpack-outliers.yaml)
